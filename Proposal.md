#### Project Goal
To find a relationship between stocks and Google Trends. This will be done for each company in the Fortune 500. We will then examine whether certain companies/industries are positively or negatively affected by increased publicity.

### What is the need? Who wants or benefits?
Stocks & Searches will help us to understand the relationship between the public and the stock market. It will give insight into whether or not Americans are keeping knowledgeable about the companies they are investing in.

We hope to learn what industries are benefitted by publicity. This could give potential guidance to public relations officers at certain companies.

### What data (or datasets)?
Stocks & Searches will use data from Google Trends. The data can be downloaded in CSV form. It describes the relative number of searches over time as well as the regions where the term was searched. This data is accessible via Google's API.
We can acquire stock data from Yahoo Finance.

### What is your "data science" toolkit? You should list specific tools / packages you will use.
- Google API
  - We will use this API to get our search data
- Analysis
  - ???

### Incremental Steps to Completion
1. Acquire all relevant data
2.


### Preliminary sketch of what you hope to find.
We are hoping to find a correlation between stock prices and google searches. Ideally, we will find that searches for a company's name will precede a change in their stock prices.

We hope to find which industries are benefitted by publicity and which are hurt by it.
