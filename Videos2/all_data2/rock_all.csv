FIRST SIGHT
Turns me aroundagain
Brings me face to face with my sin
I've got it, always had it
A reason to look within now
TAKE FLIGHT
To your sun again
Burns the sin straight from my hands
I've got it, always had it
A reason to live within now

You catch me
And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me

LYRICS

I watched you walk away
Hopeless, with nothing to say
I strain my eyes
Hoping to see you again

This is my curse (the longing)
This is my curse (time)
This is my curse (the yearning)
This is my curse

There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you be there?

Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you

This is my curse (the wanting)
This is my curse (time)
This is my curse (the needing)
This is my curse

There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?

And still I want
And still I ache
But still I wait
To see you again

Dying, inside, these walls [2x]

And I see your face in these tears
In these tears
And I see your face...

Lyrics:

Time feels like I've been back in jail
Like when I was doing time but in the can
Spend all night on a bended knee
Just to beg for something to believe
Left home with a pack of clothes without a family tree

This fight could be the last fight
No giving and no winning
One time could be the all the time
Should we decide to end the misery

Time heals all of the burned out bridges
Filled with nothing more than misery
I wear themask of the embattled son
Trying to beg for something to believe
Left home with a pack of clothes without a family tree

Break the chains of featherweights and giants
With the stain forever lasting liars
They're afraid when we spit out the fire
And start living",6044900,4.91926240921,15728,324,00:04:02,242,"[velvet revolver the last fight, velvet revolver vevo, fall to pieces, the last fight official, channel, libertad, hq, official, cover, rock, guns n roses, karaoke, download, music, Velvet Revolver, playlist, the last fight lyrics, RCA Records Label, velvet revolver official, velvet revolver live, audio, lyrics, live, music video, vevo, Sony, contraband, Rock, slither, velvet revolver lyrics, album, espanol, acoustic, alt, metal, official video]",2009-10-03 04:29:53,10,20,30,260,260,240,0,10,20,20,30,40,80,80,60,0,20,20,60,60,40,110,110,90,50,50,30,110,100,80,rock

I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

LYRICS
Yeah, yeah

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy Diver
YEAH
(YEAH)

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you - look out!

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh, we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away - get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel - yeah!

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

Jump, Jump
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen - yeah!

(Holy Diver...)
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me? - No? Yeah!

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away, get away (get away!)
Gotta get away, get away - yeah, yeah

Holy Diver, sole survivor
Your heart is clean

Lyrics:

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you

Lyrics:

Realized I can never win
Sometimes I feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me why am I to blame
Aren't we suppose to be the same
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last

Lyrics:

I can't stand to let you win.
I'm just watching you.
And I don't know what to do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Feeling all the hurt you hide.
Thought you were my friend.
Seems it never ends. 
I need somebody someone.
Can't somebody help me.
All I need is to be.
Loved just for me. 

Giving you this and that.
Giving gave nothing back.
It's all related to.
All the things I do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Seeing all the things you tried.
I am nothing.",13893193,4.92843532562,53027,966,00:03:53,233,"[somebody someone, blind, twisted transistor, coming undone, got the life, hq, official, somebody someone official music video, Somebody Someone, somebody someone cover, cover, a.d.i.d.a.s, karaoke, korn, word up, download, music, clown, here to stay, lyrics, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Epic/Immortal, Korn, somebody someone live, make me bad, somebody someone lyrics, album, acoustic, official video, falling away from me, somebody, someone]",2009-10-25 08:30:59,0,10,20,0,10,30,0,0,20,0,10,40,0,0,30,10,20,30,10,10,30,10,20,40,0,20,30,0,0,40,rock

""Helena"" Lyrics:

Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you

Burning on just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst to take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Came a time
When every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst to take (worst you take)
from every heart you break (heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend
to leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide?

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight",13084310,4.86517238617,55615,1940,00:03:31,211,"[My Chemical Romance, Helena, Alternative Rock, Punk Rock (Musical Genre), Music (TV Genre), Gerard Way, Warner Music, Official, Music Video]",2007-04-18 21:54:55,20,0,0,30,0,0,20,10,0,30,10,0,40,0,0,60,0,0,230,230,210,20,0,0,70,0,0,60,10,0,rock

I like to make a whole video to go along with songs. The reason I always do that for my videos is because I know a lot of people who feel better and enjoy the song more when they watch pictures and a video with it, rather than just one picture through the whole song. I hope you all enjoy this and my other videos too!

Mentor Williams wrote the song ""Drift Away"" and it was originally performed by John Henry Kurtz in his 1972 album ""Reunion"". Dobie Gray did this song in 1973 and his is the most popular version. Uncle Kracker then performed this in 2003.

A friend of mine also did his own video of this original song, which was by Dobie Gray. Check his out:

Lyrics:

And you neglected I called you out
don't please
I said we're stronger than this now
You resurrected mistakes
years past it seemed
And they exist to still haunt you

And still you feel like the loneliness
Is better replaced by this
I don't believe it this way
And I can see the fear in your eyes
I've seen it materialize
Growing stronger each day

I could see it as you turned to stone
Still clearly I can hear you say
Don't leave, don't give up on me
Two weeks and you ran away
I remember don't lie to me
You couldn't see that it was not that way
Swear I never gave up on you",18451134,4.88086223602,79775,2449,00:04:19,259,"[overcome full album, overcome, hq, official, All That Remains, cover, karaoke, download, All That Remains live, music, playlist, live 2014, this probably won't end well, guitar cover, audio, this calling, All That Remains lyrics, lyrics, live, music video, the order of things, vevo, Sony, drum cover, what if I was nothing, Two Weeks, six, album, Prosthetic/Razor & Tie, acoustic, all that remains album, official video, Pop, single, all, that]",2009-11-24 06:00:30,0,20,0,20,0,0,10,20,0,20,10,0,0,30,0,30,0,0,0,20,10,10,30,10,20,20,0,20,30,10,rock

68,Seether- Rise Above this (Official Video).3gp,PRAIREDAWG69,"Artist: Seether
Song: Rise above this
Album: Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces

an amazing song by seether. this is the official music video. Seether's lead singer actually based this song on a real life event. one in which his brother committed suicide. So this song is really meaningful i'm assuming.

Lyrics:

Take the light, undarken everything around me
Call the clouds and listen closely I'm lost without you
Call your name every day when I feel so helpless
I've fallen down but I'll rise above this, rise above this

Hate the mind, regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know, this void will grow
And everything's in vain, distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right, but I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day when I feel so helpless
I've fallen down but I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name every day when I seem so helpless
I've fallen down, and I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

I'll mend myself before it gets me 
(I'll mend myself before it gets me)
I'll mend myself before it gets me 
(I'll mend myself before it gets me)

Call your name every day when I feel so helpless
I've fallen down but I'll rise above this, rise above this
Forty eight ways to say that I'm feelin' helpless
I'm Falling down, falling down, but I'll rise above this, rise above this, 
Rise above this, rise above this doubt",594561,4.95456409454,2437,28,00:03:34,214,"[Seether, Rise, above, this, official, video, finding, beauty, in, negative, spaces, music, suicide, guitar, rock, metal]",2008-12-01 05:08:32,60,70,50,40,50,30,60,60,40,50,60,40,50,50,30,40,40,20,30,30,10,20,30,10,0,10,20,70,70,50,rock

Lyrics: 

Take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all
Take it and take it and take it until you take us all
Smash it and crash it and thrash it and trash it
You know they're only toys
Try it you'll like it don't hide it don't fight it, just let it out
Steal and shoot it and kill it or take another route
Take it and take it and take it
You know they're only toys

Devour Devour
Suffocate your own empire
Devour Devour
It's your final hour

Devour Devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour Devour
What a way to go

You want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
Well here it is
Everything everything everything
Isn't so primitive

Take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all
Nobody nobody wants to feel like this
Nobody nobody wants to live like this
Nobody nobody wants a war like this

Devour Devour
Suffocate your own empire
Devour Devour
It's your final hour

Devour Devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour Devour
What a way to go
What a way to go

Diving down
Round and round
diving down
round and round

Devour Devour
Suffocate your own empire
Devour Devour
It's your final hour

Devour Devour
Stolen like a foreign soul
Devour Devour
What a way to go

Devour Devour
Suffocate your own empire
Devour Devour
It's your final hour

Lyrics:

Better than watching Gellar bending silver spoons.
Better than witnessing new born nebulaes in bloom.
She who sees from 'up-high' smiles and surely sings.
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings.

I haven't felt the way I feel today
in so long it's hard for me to specify.
I'm beginning to notice how much this feels like a waking limb...
pins and needles,
nice to know you,
goodbye!",8452239,4.9324016571,25538,439,00:04:48,288,"[dig, love hurts, official, hq, pardon me, Incubus lyrics, cover, download, music, Incubus Nice To Know You, Adolescents, lyrics, IncubusVevo, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Epic/Immortal, original, Alternative, are you in, album, acoustic, Nice To Know You lyrics, official video, Incubus, Anna molly, aqueous transmission, Nice To Know You live, single, absolution calling, wish you were here, Nice To Know You, stellar, Nice, To, Know]",2009-10-25 08:31:00,0,10,20,0,20,20,0,10,20,40,60,50,70,90,80,30,50,40,10,30,30,60,80,70,10,30,20,50,70,60,rock

Lyrics:

Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
And just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while

While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before

Lyrics:

This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Who would have guessed it
I will not leave alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around

It's never too late",116853568,4.9193520546,601064,12368,00:03:31,211,"[riff, three days grace live, official, hq, Never Too Late, never to late, rock, cover, karaoke, download, music, playlist, live 2015, audio, never too late live, lyrics, never too late, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Rock, three days grace, three days grace never too late, album, acoustic, metal, clean, official video, Jive, guitar, explicit, single, the collection, never too late lyrics, ThreeDaysGraceVevo, Three Days Grace, animal, have, too]",2009-10-03 04:50:27,30,20,10,30,20,0,20,10,0,20,20,0,40,30,20,40,30,10,40,40,20,50,50,30,30,30,10,50,40,30,rock
