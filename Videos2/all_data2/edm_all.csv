Calvin Harris - My Way (Lyrics)

Why wait 
To say
At least I did it my way 
Lie awake 
Two faced 
But in my heart I understand 
I made 
My move 
And it was all about you 
Now I feel 
So far removed 

You were the one thing in my way

Lyrics: 

Verse 1:
 
Part of me
Is part of you
So take my hand
I want you to feel
Words you can’t hear
I love you so
And you love me
So tell me why
Why does it feel
Like we’re thousand miles apart
 
Bridge:
 
For better or for worse you stood next to me 
Always found a way not to give up on me 
Remember when you used to say
 
Chorus:
 
You know our love can save it all
We’ve been together for so long
So don’t give up on who we are
We’ll work it out somehow
You know a word can change it all
I had my doubts but now i know
I wanna be with you for life
Each day and every night
Because our love can save it all
 
Verse 2:
 
I wish there was
Another me
Another you
So we could go back
To the point where we met
Another place
Another chance
We’ll make it right
So meet me halfway
I know you feel the same

Working with Diplo we discussed how he wanted to convey this simple message with a real sense of beauty, authenticity and genuine feeling. Because Fuse’s family is from Ghana, and he was over there recording, we thought it would bring a really interesting aesthetic to film the video there. Delving deeper into Ghanaian culture, we found that their traditional funeral ceremonies perfectly exemplify this sense of coming together to rise up against sadness. 

The whole community joins together, first in mourning the death, then in celebrating the life that was lived. We worked closely with a Ghanaian family and rural village, meeting the elders and receiving their blessing to film and partake in a real funeral ceremony. 

We wanted to base the video in this very real, documentary world but also tried to capture a sense of journey and passing of the deceased’s spirit by adding a surreal tone to our visuals, both in terms of the way we filmed the funeral but also by adding some more ethereal elements to the piece. 

I found a poem ""Kae” [Remember] written in a traditional Ghanaian language; Twe, which felt like the perfect companion to the video as it is about reflecting on sadness but rising up and looking to the future and to new life.

- Director Sam Pilling on marking ""Light it Up"" music video in Ghana

In your face I can see passion

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute

Take a minute, take a minute girl
Take a minute girl come sit down

Take a minute, take a minute girl
Come too far for you to feel alone
Let him walk over your heart 
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion
Come too far for you to feel alone
Let him walk over your heart 
We've come too far for you to feel alone
In your face I can see passion

It's not hard to see the girl is mine
It's not hard to see the girl is mine

After baking in the sun for what we can only assume was an exceedingly unhealthy amount of time, The Bearded Man once awoke with a start to discover that he had gone partially deaf for reasons unknown. That’s not to say he went partially deaf in the conventional sense, mind you. Rather, it appeared that selective frequencies had simply disappeared from his brain’s recognition. For example: he looked over the sea, and he could clearly hear the breeze, birds chirping, and splashing water from the beach. He looked further to a road nearby full of cars, and he heard nothing. He could quite clearly hear the children playing and laughing down the way, but when he saw two people fighting on the balcony of a nearby apartment, he heard nothing. It seemed his brain had chosen to block out all the negative sonic energy around him, only allowing the good to pass through. It was this incredible - but temporary - moment that lead him to suggest the name ‘Lost Frequencies’ for Felix de Laet.

-----
Black sunglasses, a baseball cap flipped backwards and a laptop: His visual trademarks simultaneously serve as his most important tools. Those and his keen sense for superhits that generate 9-digit streams and have so far enabled him to move crowds across the globe for the past one and a half years. The young man from Lower Saxony is actually more the reserved type, who would much rather stand behind his decks and let his music do the talking. Robin Schulz: A picture perfect career. Making his way from a local secret to the nation’s ‘next big thing’ and finally to an internationally acclaimed mega star. At age 28 the producer and DJ has already established himself as the most successful German club act to date and is now set to lay forth his sophomore album.

Robin Schulz began playing smaller clubs as a DJ somewhere in rural Lower Saxony. Meanwhile, he has travelled the world: Osnabrück, New York, Tokyo. And more importantly, the world knows him. His 2014 breakthrough single, the multi-platinum certified Top 1 remix of “Waves (feat. Mr. Probz)” was a first sign of things to come. Though not even Schulz himself could have predicted last year’s incredible snowball effect and the extent of his current success. 2014 marked the start of a fairytale summer that knew just one name: Robin Schulz. His internationally gold- and platinum-certified follow-up single “Prayer In C (feat. Lilly Wood & The Prick)” went on to become a global hit and write history, with Schulz as the first-ever German artist to reach the #1 spot of the global Shazam charts. Subsequently “Prayer In C” was officially named the “Summer Hit of 2014” and rightfully so.

Building on this success, Schulz went on to release his now gold-certified debut album “Prayer” in autumn 2014, along with the song “Sun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)”. Meanwhile Robin Schulz has sold several million records of “Prayer In C”, “Sun Goes Down” and the first single “Headlights” off his new album “SUGAR”, while generating 9-digit streams on Spotify as well as receiving numerous gold and platinum certifications. Numbers, digits and rankings that offer but an abstract image of the global pop phenomenon that is Robin Schulz.

The album’s first precursor “Headlights (feat. Ilsey)” saw Robin Schulz quickly enter the Top 10 in Germany. “Sugar (feat. Francesco Yates)” was equally quick to reach gold and is the third #1 single by the Osnabrück-born artist that also entered the German single charts, streaming charts, airplay charts and iTunes charts at #1, besides generating several million Spotify streams and counting. The song’s official music video is currently ranked among the most-watched clips on YouTube and was recently voted one of the “5 Best Dance Videos Of The Week” by music service Shazam, while Robin Schulz’s YouTube channel is officially the most successful German YouTube channel in the area of music.

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Don’t want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you’re down and then between

Ohh I really want to know…

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won’t let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you’re down and then between
Ohh I really want to know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Sigma & Rita Ora’s ‘Coming Home’ is the new single from Sigma’s debut album, ‘Life’. Unveiled this morning across UK radio, ‘Coming Home’ was the highlight of Cam and Joe’s recent Roundhouse show, when Rita joined them to perform the track live for the first time. The single is available to download from Friday 6th November, and as an iTunes ‘Instant Grat’ for fans who pre-order ‘Life’. ‘Coming Home’ sees Sigma once again collaborate with UK songwriting giants TMS and Wayne Hector (with whom they made ‘Changing’), and a stunning, acoustic version is available on the album.

Across ‘Life’s’ 20 tracks (on the deluxe edition), Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie have combined the UK’s hottest stars with the next wave of new British talent. Alongside Rita Ora, ‘Life’ features a dizzying array of collaborators including Ella Eyre, Ella Henderson, Diztortion, Maverick Sabre, Paloma Faith, Labrinth, Jacob Banks, Jetta, Bartoven, Majestic, Doctor, Nicole Jackson, and Ina Wroldsen.

Forged in the white-heat of drum & bass’s Noughties revival, Sigma have now sold over 2 million singles, with 4 hit records (2x OCC No.1s, 3 iTunes No.1s) and 2 platinum awards to date. They’ve received 2 Brits nominations, sold out their debut live tour, and played festival main stages across the world with performances including Glastonbury, Bestival, Reading & Leeds, V, T In The Park, Creamfields, SW4, EDC, Pukklepop, Sziget and beyond. They’re also the only drum & bass outfit to have performed at the BAFTAs ceremony one night, and a warehouse rave the next.

Sigma met at university while balancing raving and studying; two characters from different backgrounds (but with somewhat equally misspent youths) brought together by a shared love of hip hop and the unifying nature of Nineties post-rave dancefloors. Joe, who started learning the violin aged 3, swapped his strings, drums and keyboards for a pair of decks in his early teens, becoming a former DMC UK Champion scratch DJ when he was just 16. He started DJing at the nights that Cam – a jazz obsessive who’d become fascinated by jungle – was promoting in Leeds, they then began playing together, and later pooled their loans to buy production equipment to start creating their own music. As the band put it, their seemingly overnight success “has taken 10 years of sleepless nights”.

The last 18 months have been full of life-changing, pinch-yourself moments for both Cam and Joe, and ‘Life’ captures these ups (and downs). Alongside the hits ‘Nobody To Love’, ‘Changing’, ‘Higher’, and ‘Glitterball’, is recent single and live set opener, ‘Redemption’. The collaborations with Rita Ora (‘Coming Home’), Ella Eyre (‘Good Times’), and Maverick Sabre (‘Broken Promises’), are just some of ‘Life’s’ many standout tracks. Few debut albums contain so many hits before they’re released, but Sigma’s knack for turning soaring strings and heavy breakbeats into blow-your-speakers chart anthems shows why they’re set to dominate radio playlists and festival arenas for years to come.

Sigma have just completed their 10 date UK and Ireland live tour, which began with a sold out Warehouse Project show in Manchester, with further shows at London's Roundhouse, Newcastle, Dublin, Bristol, Sheffield, Portsmouth, Oxford, and Norwich.",18371015,4.90320014954,95806,2376,00:03:21,201,"[Music (TV Genre), sigma, Rita Ora (Celebrity), Official, The X Factor (UK) (Recurring Competition), Television (Invention), 3beat, Drum And Bass (Musical Genre)]",2015-11-05 11:00:01,140,130,120,150,140,130,170,160,150,160,150,140,130,120,110,120,110,100,180,170,160,60,70,50,190,180,170,110,110,90,edm

Featuring Nathan Barnatt as Officer Finkleman (https://www.youtube.com/barnatt)

Releasing a string of smash hits off his September 2014 debut album “Prayer” established Robin Schulz as one of the internationally most successful German artists of the past 20 years. Now, the Osnabrück-native, superstar DJ and producer is set to release his highly-anticipated follow-up longplayer: Almost exactly one year after the release of his globally acclaimed breakthrough debut, Schulz is back on track with yet another stroke of genius: Promisingly entitled “SUGAR”, album no. 2 will be released later this year on September 18th!

Earlier this July, Schulz was awarded Triple Gold for his tremendous hit single “Prayer in C”, Platinum for “Sun Goes Down (feat. Jasmine Thompson)” as well as Gold for his debut album “Prayer” in his home territory – just 3 on a list of over 60(!) awards already amassed by the German deep house shooting star. In light of his upcoming new longplayer “SUGAR”, Robin Schulz is now about to take the next step in his amazingly successful career:

After his airplay #1 and global smash single “Headlights” (feat. Ilsey) which delivered the first taste of his new album’s sound, the twentysomething is set to release the eponymous second single on July 17th: “Sugar”, featuring 19-year-old Canadian singer Francesco Yates. Yates is widely considered the next big popstar in the making and his soulful falsetto vocals are quickly gaining praise by superstars such as Pharrell Williams or Justin Bieber. 

That being said, Schulz is more than likely to build on his peerless, record-breaking achievements of the past 18 months: Last year’s mega hit “Prayer in C” landed Robin Schulz the #1 spot on iTunes in 40 countries and topped the national singles charts in 17 countries, but that was just the beginning. His #1 remix of “Waves” earned him a Grammy nomination, while his Top 7 album “Prayer” received the German ECHO award for best “Dance National”, in addition to a completely sold-out US tour. 

Today, Schulz remains the first German artist to attain the #1 spot in the global Shazam charts. He runs the most successful German YouTube music channel with a combined 330 million views, while generating downloads and streams in excess of nine figures. 

On the heels of his recent tour of the U.S., Canada, South Africa and Australia, Robin Schulz will be headlining major electro & dance festivals all over the world throughout the summer, such as Belgium’s Tomorrowland Festival.

[Zara Larsson:]
I used to be so happy
But without youhere I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)
'Til the day I die ('til the day I die)

[MNEK:]
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what would happen
If we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind (take you off my mind)

[Zara Larsson:]
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

[Both:]
Feeling it, loving it
Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tired and I can't hide my connection with you

Feeling it, loving it
Everythingthat we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I metyou
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
That I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die... [6x]

I will never forget you...

'Til the day I die.

Lyrics:
It’s been just four days but its outta my hands
When I wake alone, I am catching my breath
And when I close my eyes, I get lost in your face
I’m gonna fall fall hard, no I don’t give a damn
I wanna love out loud, but I’m scared to say
It’s like a ton of bricks that wont fade away
I do it for
I do it for you
Now you’re in my head, and its outta my hands
When you’re in my thoughts, I don’t wanna pretend
And I lose control, with you
But you’re in my head, but you’re in my head
I do it for
I do it for you
Think I won’t feel a thing, if I give it some time
But your love is a wave, washin over my mind
When I stand my ground, I only get high
Being next to you, my heart is on fire
Now you’re in my head, and its outta my hands
When you’re in my thoughts, I don’t wanna pretend
And I lose control, with you
But you’re in my head, but you’re in my head",6097587,4.89902496338,59272,1535,00:03:49,229,"[galantis, in my head, galantis in my head, in my head galantis, galontis, golontis, I do it for you, Now you’re in my head, its outta my hands, galantis love on me, love on me galantis, love on me, galantis hook n sling, galantis love, galantis & hook n sling- love on me, galantis love on me lyrics, hook n sling, glantis, galantis hook n sling love on me, love on, glantis love on me, love on me galantis & hook n sling, hook n sling galantis, galantis - love on me]",2015-10-26 18:00:02,10,20,30,20,30,40,60,50,40,50,40,30,70,60,50,10,20,30,70,50,40,80,70,60,30,40,50,80,60,50,edm

Ahead of their headlining set at Electric Zoo: Transformed this Saturday, September 5, Above & Beyond are pleased to share a new music video as the official Electric Zoo: Transformed anthem “Fly To New York”. In addition to the Above & Beyond vs. Jason Ross Club Mix, which is out this Friday, September 4, remixes from Tom Middleton and Aero Chord will be released on September 16. 

Written with their long-time collaborator Zoë Johnston, “Fly To New York” is a dream speaking: a journey through the loss of love, and the dichotomy between reality and the dream of what could have been. Zoë explains, “There’s a knowing feeling that this is obviously a work of fiction and will never come true - however the dream is so beautiful and inviting that inevitably there's a sadness about these two 'realities' existing side by side.”

Lyrics

Silence is my worst
Silence is my worst
my worst enemy
All I do is just
All I do is just
revisit this memory

Cause you can’t take back what you didn’t say
If I could do it now
do it now
I would do it now
Cause you can’t break promises you never made
If I could do it now
do it now
I would do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now
Woah
Don’t be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping the videos on replay
People will go but feelings they stay
Woah
If I had a second chance at love
I would do it now

Sorry doesn’t work
Sorry doesn’t work
If it’s a thing you say everyday
Feelings that come back
Feelings that come back
Never went away
No they never went away

Cause you can’t take back what you didn’t say
If I could do it now
Do it now
I would do it now
Can you give back the breath that you took away
Won’t you do it now
do it now
Won’t you do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now
Woah
Don’t be fooled by how your life has turned out
Walking around in circles all day
Keeping the videos on replay
People will go but feelings they stay
Woah
If I had a second chance at love
I would do it now

Woah
Put your best suit on and carry on now

‘Alone No More’ is the follow up to the biggest selling dance record of 2015, Philip George’s ‘Wish You Were Mine’, which recently went platinum in the UK.


It’s been a life-changing, almost surreal story for 22 year old Philip George. Just 8 months ago, he was folding clothes at his day job in Next and serving pints at night at his local golf club, heading home to make music in his bedroom and uploading to a growing army of SoundCloud followers. Fast-forward to summer 2015 and he’s sold over 700,000 copies and amassed over 165,000 global radio plays of ‘Wish You Were Mine’ – a debut single that came with Stevie Wonder and Motown’s blessing.

Since the release of ‘Wish You Were Mine’, Philip’s been honing his production skills in a Nottingham studio, dropping new club tracks for his own sets and remixes for the flood of requests that have come his way. Earmarked as one of the UK’s most promising DJ/producers in years, you can hear a strong musical grounding in everything he does – he’s classically trained on the piano and also plays drums – alongside a deep knowledge of electronic music.

With forthcoming gigs at Bestival, Creamfields, and Warehouse Project, a summer residency at Cream at Amnesia, and shows at Stealth, We R Fstvl, EDC UK, Sankeys Ibiza, V Festival, and Made, Philip’s shared the stage with the DJs and producers he used to read about, from Duke Dumont to Hannah Wants and beyond. And he’s having the time of his life.

On ‘Alone No More’, Philip’s teamed up with Anton Powers, the A&R at 3 Beat who first discovered, then nurtured and mentored him (hence the collaboration on this track). As well as working at 3 Beat, the home of Sigma, Preditah, and others, Anton is one of Northern England’s most popular DJs, having been voted Liverpool DJ of the year for 3 consecutive years. For the past 14 years he’s held two key dance radio shows on Juice FM and Radio City 96.7, as well as being a mainstay at a host of events including Creamfields and further afield at Zero Gravity Dubai, and Pukka Up and Ocean Beach in Ibiza.

‘Alone No More’ has all the hallmarks of Philip George’s peaktime sound, with the energy, the excitement and the hooks he creates to ensure no-one on the dancefloor is left standing.",20599259,4.90448856354,87810,2148,00:03:03,183,"[Anton Powers (Musical Artist), Philip George, Be Alone No More (Composition), Electronic Music (Media Genre), Official, Box, Music (TV Genre)]",2015-09-10 17:00:01,10,20,30,20,40,40,10,30,30,20,30,40,10,10,30,180,160,140,170,150,130,180,250,250,170,250,250,230,260,260,edm

Another big record by Joe Stone, now working his house magic together with Daser on this energy packed groove. Centerpiece is the 90s vocal sample, creating a classic vibe, while the bassline and underlying rhythm is pure 21st century dance hotness. Freak (And You Know It) is all that, and will get under your skin for many, many partynights to come!
