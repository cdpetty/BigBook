Lyrics: 


In a little cabere
In a south texas boarder town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from all around
And all the girls
From there to Austin
Were slippin' away from home
And puttin' jewlery and hopped to take the trip
To go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it down
But give him his guitar
And he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls
From nine to ninety
Were snappin' fingers
Tappin' toes
And beggin' him don't stop
And hypnotized
And fasinated
By the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone
And no one ever saw him 'round
He vanished like the breeze
They forgot him in the little town
But all the girls
Still dreamed about him
And hung around
The cabere until the doors were locked
And then one day
On the hit parade
Was the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play",3988110,4.83661937714,12892,549,00:06:34,394,"[Tennessee, Flat, Top, Box, Rosanne, Cash, tribute, concert, memorial, Johnny, 2003]",2010-09-10 16:17:27,20,20,40,30,30,50,20,20,50,20,30,50,30,30,60,20,30,60,10,10,30,50,30,30,10,20,60,20,30,70,country

Lyrics:

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you",17015418,4.89586210251,92367,2469,00:04:01,241,"[Lonestar official, Not A Day Goes By, hq, official, stripped, Lonestar, Lonestar live, Cash, Lonestar Amazed lyrics, Lonestar Amazed, cover, full album, Front Porch Looking In, karaoke, download, piano, music, playlist, best of, Lonestar Amazed live, audio, lyrics, live, music video, vevo, Sony, album, acoustic, Mr Mom, official video, I'm already there, single, Lonestar lyrics, Walking In Memphis, instrumental, LonestarVEVO, Country, Best, of]",2011-03-05 09:03:31,0,10,20,0,10,30,0,20,20,0,20,30,0,0,20,0,20,40,10,20,30,0,10,40,0,30,40,0,30,50,country

13,Passionate Kisses - Mary Chapin Carpenter.mp4,Carey McGleish,"Taken from the ""Jubilee: Live at Wolf Trap"" (1995) performance and found on the album ""Come On, Come On"". 

Mary Chapin Carpenter was born Feb. 21, 1958, in Princeton, N.J. Her father was an executive for Life magazine, and she spent part of her early life living in Japan. She grew up with a love of contemporary pop hits, although her mother's Woody Guthrie and Judy Collins records gave her some interest in country/folk music. She spent her time at home with her guitar, and her father encouraged her to perform at talent nights.

Enrolling in Brown University, Carpenter earned a degree in American civilization. Between college years she would play local bars and clubs in the Washington, DC area.  By 1986, she was a local star, winning five Washington Area Music Awards. She released her 1987 debut ""Hometown Girl"", produced by guitarist/producer John Jennings.

She returns to Washington almost every summer to perform at the popular outdoor venue Wolftrap.

Passionate Kisses lyrics:

Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Do I want too much
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
""Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right""
Shouldn't I have this (shouldn't I)
Shouldn't I have this (shouldn't I)
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

I haven't seen you in forever
Oh you haven't changed a bit
You didn't think that I would remember
How could I forget

Made a wish on every star

To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

wearin' holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
been dreamin' of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now..for mexico

and no shoes, no shirt, and no problems!

want to look thru my shades and see you there with me
Want to soak up life for a while
In laid back mode

No shoes, no shirt, no problems 
Blues what blues hey I forgot them

Lyrics:

It was 700 fence posts 
from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
sometimes it was rainin and sometimes it would shine
we wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

I start walkin your way you start walkin mine
we meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
We gain a lot of ground cuz we both give a little
aint no road to long when we meet in the middle
It's been 7 years tomorrow since we said our vows
under that old pine tree you oughta see it now
standin in the backyard remindin me and you
that if we don't see eye to eye 
there's something we can do",5568474,4.8870844841,21722,631,00:03:50,230,"[Diamond Rio live, Diamond Rio Meet In The Middle live, hq, official, stripped, Diamond Rio, DiamondRioVEVO, cover, full album, karaoke, download, piano, music, Unbelievable, Arista Nashville, Diamond Rio Meet In The Middle, Beautiful Mess, Love A Little Stronger, Meet In The Middle, audio, I Believe, lyrics, live, music video, vevo, Sony, album, acoustic, official video, Meet In The Middle lyrics, single, Diamond Rio lyrics, Best, of, Diamond]",2009-10-25 08:15:52,30,10,10,30,20,10,50,10,10,20,10,30,40,20,20,40,10,10,40,20,10,90,10,10,20,10,40,60,10,10,country

Lyrics:

I said I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly

I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars

Oh it sounds good to me I said

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can
Into the wild blue
Set me free oh I pray

Closer to you closer to you",2696498,4.90167045593,10277,259,00:04:51,291,"[dixie chicks, cowboy take me away, live, lyrics, acoustic, session, official, official video, cover, karaoke, cowboy, take me away, instrumental, hd, hq, travelin soldier, landslide, wide open spaces, country, country music, dixy, dixiechicksvevo, Dixie, chicks]",2011-11-29 08:00:00,120,10,150,120,10,150,120,10,150,110,10,150,120,10,160,120,10,150,20,10,0,110,10,150,30,20,10,250,230,260,country

That I spoke your name? 
Well, that's insane 
I've hardly noticed you're not here 

That I showed your picture to some stranger?
Don't you think I've got no pride? 
They've been here at home 
Face-down on a shelf

But if they were true
What would it matter to you? 
Would it change the way you feel? 
If the rumors were right
Would you be here tonight 
To help this old heart heal? 

Well, don't worry 
It wasn't me 
Just someone whose world was torn in two 
Someone who looked a lot like me 
And loved someone like you

Lyrics:

To the teller down at the bank
You're just another checking account
To the plumber that came today
You're just another house
At the airport ticket counter
You're just another fare
At the beauty shop at the mall
Well you're just another head of hair
Well that's alright, that's ok

Lyrics:

Standing at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back
Let's face it

For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouringrain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out and I'm gonna' take it

I don't wanna' spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by

Lyrics:

Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
My heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely

Lyrics:

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was gonna go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

They got a alligator stew and a crawfish pie
A golf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin on the delta's quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
And here up north it's a cold cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says: Beausoleil is coming into town
Baby let's go down

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 1910
You gonna feel a little bit young again
Well you learnedto dance with your rock'n'roll
You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-so-do
When you hear a little Jolie Blon

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more

Lyrics:

When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds upfeeling more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes

And then all of a sudden
Oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing
To a family
Lookin' back all I can say
About all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad
That he didn't have to be",11232938,4.93205356598,51099,883,00:03:52,232,"[brad paisley he didn't have to be lyrics, crushin it, she's everything, hq, official, brad paisley lyrics, dad he didn't have to be, the world, cover, karaoke, brad paisley official, download, music, remind me, playlist, Arista Nashville, he didn't have to be, audio, brad paisley songs, lyrics, live, music video, vevo, Sony, subtitulada, album, gospel songs, acoustic, He Didn't Have To Be, brad paisley he didn't have to be live, official video]",2009-10-03 04:29:24,260,260,240,260,250,240,250,260,240,240,260,250,260,250,230,260,250,240,240,260,260,260,260,240,250,260,240,260,260,230,country

51,Carrie Underwood ~ Just A Dream (lyrics).3gp,jessdatsme,"Carrie Underwood Just A Dream lyrics

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh,
Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, now I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Lyrics:

She and I live in our own little world
Don't worry about the world outside

She and I agree 
She and I lead a perfectly normal life
Ah but just because we aren't often seen socially
People think we've got something to hide.
But all our friends know we're just a little old fashioned
She and I 

Oh ain't that great 
Aint it fine
To have a love someone that others can't find
Aint it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us
She and I 
So wonderful

Lyrics:

Mama you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watch me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer
To your prayers
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good, he makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me

It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught.

Lyrics:

We didn't know that times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Chopin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had.

As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt - the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand.

We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.",3240484,4.8985452652,10721,279,00:02:59,179,"[high, cotton, official, video, she and i, mountain music, the closer you get, single, hq, RCA, Records, Label, Nashville, album, high cotton, remix, download, tribute, to, alabama, official video, lyrics, Alabama, dixieland delight, cover, high cotton karaoke]",2009-10-25 08:21:46,0,20,0,10,20,0,20,10,0,20,20,0,0,20,10,20,0,0,0,20,20,30,20,0,20,30,0,30,0,0,country
