13,Passionate Kisses - Mary Chapin Carpenter.mp4,Carey McGleish,"Taken from the ""Jubilee: Live at Wolf Trap"" (1995) performance and found on the album ""Come On, Come On"". Mary Chapin Carpenter was born Feb. 21, 1958, in Princeton, N.J. Her father was an executive for Life magazine, and she spent part of her early life living in Japan. She grew up with a love of contemporary pop hits, although her mother's Woody Guthrie and Judy Collins records gave her some interest in country/folk music. She spent her time at home with her guitar, and her father encouraged her to perform at talent nights.Enrolling in Brown University, Carpenter earned a degree in American civilization. Between college years she would play local bars and clubs in the Washington, DC area.  By 1986, she was a local star, winning five Washington Area Music Awards. She released her 1987 debut ""Hometown Girl"", produced by guitarist/producer John Jennings.She returns to Washington almost every summer to perform at the popular outdoor venue Wolftrap.Passionate Kisses lyrics:Is it too much to askI want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my backFood to fill me upAnd warm clothes and all that stuffShouldn't I have thisShouldn't I have thisShouldn't I have all of this, andPassionate kissesPassionate kisses, whoa oh ohPassionate kisses from youIs it too much to demandI want a full house and a rock and roll bandPens that won't run out of inkAnd cool quiet and time to thinkShouldn't I have thisShouldn't I have thisShouldn't I have all of this, andPassionate kissesPassionate kisses, whoa oh ohPassionate kisses from youDo I want too muchAm I going overboard to want that touchI shout it out to the night""Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right""Shouldn't I have this (shouldn't I)Shouldn't I have this (shouldn't I)Shouldn't I have all of this, andPassionate kissesPassionate kisses, whoa oh ohPassionate kisses from youPassionate kissesPassionate kisses, whoa oh ohPassionate kisses from you",640817,4.910559177,1574,36,0:04:01,241,"[Passionate, Kisses, Mary, Chapin, Carpenter, acoustic, live concert, folk music, guitar, Wolf Trap, Come On Come On, Stones In The Road, live music]",5/19/11 8:01,260,250,220,260,250,210,20,0,0,20,10,0,30,10,0,0,20,10,30,0,0,260,250,200,0,10,20,260,240,210,country
