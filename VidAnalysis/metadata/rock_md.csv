LYRICS: 
So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel I appreciate the time I’m not alone
(Why don’t you get my lawyer on the phone)
 
There were days these child eyes 
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate… and oh I felt control
(It appears these sheep have quite an appetite)
 
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
 
As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn’t notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, Everyone’s got a sob story)
 
Jesus Christ, was born to die 
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We’re simply sociopaths with no communication baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(So, what’s your cross to bear)
 
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way 
I believe in answers 
Just not today   
 
Hope my wheels don’t abandon me now, seein’ that I’m out here alone
I’m runnin’ out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice, guiding me to her arms
Mother, I’m alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind 
Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time to wake up
Won’t you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?  Just wake up
Can’t you wake up?
 
(You do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way 
I believe in answers 
Just not today

LYRICS: 

You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
The neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive

LYRICS

I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,
But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.
My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from,
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,

It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face,
Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.",748106349,4.86913585663,4574984,154738,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, stressed out, 21 pilots, twentyonepilots, fueled by ramen, FBR, fueledbyramen, music, song, tyler joseph, josh dun, TOP]",2015-04-28 03:05:18

LYRICS

I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.",297410644,4.91078805923,2080947,47470,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, ride, blurry face, Fueled By Ramen, FBR, 21 pilots, twentyone pilots, fueledbyramen, tyler joseph, josh dun]",2015-05-13 22:00:26

Stuck in the same routine 
Living an empty dream
When am I gonna wake up　
Thought we had it right　
Now it's an endless night　
Where is it gonna take us

I know i know 
we’re taking off together 
even though we always  
crash and burn　
tonight you and I 
will fall from the sky　
drag me all the way to hell　
cuz I’m never gonna let it go 
never gonna let it go　

Build a broken heart 
Watching it fall apart　
Maybe this is how I like it　
Sink your teeth in
Give me what I want　
Love the way it hurts

LYRICS
You don't have to lie
I know exactly where you've been
Cos' you're chewing off my ear
While you're chewing on your chin
No we're not on the level
You're just off your face
It's not a state of mind no
Your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside
But you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now
I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party
Cos it never stops
Now one is too many
But it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy
Cos this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Who you trying to fool
You know you're in over your head
Cos' your holding on to heaven
But you're hanging by a thread.
Oh no.

LYRICS
So now this ship is sinking
I don’t know what to do
It’s got me thinking that I
Don’t need 
Don’t need you

Too many wrong decisions
You didn’t think this through 
So what I’m saying is I
Don’t need
Don’t need you

Open your eyes and see
What we have become
This isn’t living it’s existing 
And I just can’t take this shit 
 and hurt anymore
hurt anymore so

Bury me with all you got
It never stops never ends gotta try and
let it out let it go
Is this the end? 
‘Cos it might just break me

Look at us now we’re fucked 
And nothing’s the same
The biggest piece of me is missing and I just can’t   
take this life or try anymore
I just don’t care so come and 

It never stops it never ends
Is it too late to make amends",3776323,4.88992214203,90677,2566,00:04:53,293,"[Bullet, For, My, Valentine, Don't, Need, You, Spinefarm, Records, Metal]",2016-11-06 22:00:00

Been waitin at these crossroads
Forever and a day
On a guy to buy my soul

I spend all night and day
How much harder can I play
You know I gave my life to Rock n' Roll

Here we go

Momma begged me please
Yes she got down on her knees
Said 'You'll burn in that Mississippi sun'
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So Mama don't you have no fear
I’m either last or I've already won..

Here I go

Take me down
(won't you)

Standing at the crossroads 
A dried up pen in hand
The conversation went like this
'Tell me your desire…why you pulled me from the fire 
and we'll seal the deal with a kiss'
said 'I wanna raise the dead
Find a note that I can shred
On my walls I scrawl my gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As long as I'm alive
All I wanna do is Rock'

Take me down
(won't you)

Sign with the devil

Take me down
(won't you)

27,Robbie Williams _ Party Like A Russian - Official Video.mp4,Robbie Williams,"Official video for the first single from The Heavy Entertainment Show, out now: https://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/hesdeluxeID

Standard edition: https://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/hesID
Deluxe edition: https://RobbieWilliams.lnk.to/hesdeluxeID

==========

The track’s lyrics are a light-hearted homage to the idea of the Russian party lifestyle. Robbie says:

“Part of the British identity is that we all believe we’re the best at partying, most nations think that of themselves … but there ain’t no party like a Russian Party (sorry S Club 7). It's not about being Russian, but it's about partying like a Russian.""

==========

Party Like A Russian lyrics:

It takes a certain kind of man with a certain reputation
To alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation
Take my loose change and build my own space station
(Just because you can, man)

Ain’t no refutin’ or disputin’ I’m a modern Rasputin
Subcontract disputes to some brutes in Louboutin
Act highfalootin’ while my boys put the boot in 
(They do the can-can)

Spasibo

Party like a Russian
End of discussion
Dance like you’ve got concussion, oh
Put a doll inside a doll

Party like a Russian
Disco seduction 
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

I got Stolly and Bolly and Molly so I’m jolly
And I’m always off my trolley so I never say sorry 
There’s a doll inside a doll inside a doll inside a dolly
(Hello dolly)

I put a bank inside a car inside a plane inside a boat
It takes half the western world just to keep the ship afloat
And I never ever smile unless there’s something to promote
I just won’t emote

Spasibo

Party like a Russian
End of discussion 
Dance like you’ve got concussion, oh 
We’ve got soul and we’ve got gold


Party like a Russian
Disco seduction
Party like a Russian, oh
Have it like an oligarch

“We’re the Russian boys, we’re everywhere
There’s revolution in the air!
Oh-Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh”

THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE

THESE FOUR WALLS HAVE GOT A STORY TO TELL
THE DOOR IS OFF THE HINGES THERE’S NO WISH IN THE WELL.
OUTSIDE THE SKY IS COAL BLACK AND THE STREETS ARE ON FIRE
THE PICTURE WINDOWS CRACKED 
AND THERE’S NO WHERE TO RUN 
I KNOW I KNOW ..
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE 

I SET EACH STONE AND I HAMMERED EACH NAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE
WHERE MEMORIES LIVE AND THE DREAM DON’T FAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE.
COMING HOME,
I’M COMING HOME

DROVE A SPIKE INTO THE GROUND AND I STAKED MY CLAIM
STANDING ON THE DIRT WHERE THEY’LL DIG MY GRAVE.
NOW WHAT BUILT THESE WALLS IS IN MY VEINS 
NO TIME FOR LOOKING BACK, THE WOLF IS AT THE DOOR 
THIS HEART, THIS SOUL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE.

I SET EACH STONE AND I HAMMERED EACH NAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE
WHERE MEMORIES LIVE AND THE DREAM DON’T FAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE
COMING HOME, 
I’M COMING HOME

THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT ON TRUST
THATS WHAT IT IS 
AND ALWAYS WAS
NO WRECKING BALL COULD KNOCK IT DOWN
THIS HOUSE, WAS BUILT ON HIGHER GROUND.

I SET EACH STONE AND I HAMMERED EACH NAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE
WHERE MEMORIES LIVE AND THE DREAM DON’T FAIL
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE.

COMING HOME
I’M COMING HOME
COMING HOME
I’M COMING HOME
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE
COMING HOME
I’M COMING HOME
I’M COMING HOME
THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE

FEEL INVINCIBLE 

Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sites
No surrender no
Trigger fingers go
living the dangerous life
Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up
They're knocking me down
(Chewing me up spitting me out)
Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
You're making me strong
You're making me stand
(Never will fall never will end)

Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song raising up
Like the roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
(I'm made of fire)
Who can stop me tonight
(I'm hard wired)
You make me feel invincible
I feel I feel it
Invincible

Here we go again
I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight
Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life
Hey hey hey everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone they say that they've won
(The bell has been rung it's over and done)
Hey hey hey when I need to be saved
They're counting me out but this is my round
(You in my corner look at me now)

You make me feel invincible
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Not gonna stop

Lyrics:

all bets are off but you still think that you've gotta a right well
you're lucky days are numbered now 
(and your to blame)
you built a castle of sand. 
shaking the devil's hand well
at least i've still got my soul to sell.

you've got to take me away
cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)

help me escape cause i wanna be
(I’ll take my last breath)
left to be free
i just wanna fake my own death

you played your part of the whore
you  got some kinda nerve or
have you forgot i don't forget
(and your too late)
you walk beside the dead where
the angels never tread well
at least i've still got a soul to sell.

you've got to take me away
cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)

help me escape cause i wanna be
(I’ll take my last breath)
left to be free
i just wanna fake my own death

there's nowhere to run
from hell and above
i swear to a god that someday
there will be blood.

it all comes down in the end in spite of me you do it all again.
it all comes down in the end in spite of you I’ll do it all again.

you've got to take me away
cause i wanna feel (wanna feel)
something that's real (thing that’s real)

help me escape cause i wanna be
(I’ll take my last breath)
left to be free
i just wanna fake my own death

I am sick of this place of death
With a pace that’s set
And you know the pessimistic bend
Just to watch you break
Practice what you preach

Separate skin from the bone
Digging at my flesh
Like a schizophrenic with a blade
Fingers tracing scars
Mapping out reminders of just how much I can take

Pressure in my brain
My shoulders take the weight
Back’s about to break

Pain
Every day when I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there’s nothing left that you can take away from me

Pain

Because I’ve seen it before
I’ve lived it before
I’ve been there before 
Incarnate
So don’t you ever underestimate me

Daily death
Crooning in my ear
Things I wanna hear
Turn my head and bite my tongue 
Spitting blood on my pre-determined grave
This is all a game

Pressure in my brain
My shoulders take the weight
Back’s about to break
This is all a game

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there’s nothing left that you can take away from me

Pain.

Footprints in the sand
That can’t be washed away
It breeds while we’re asleep
It feeds when we awake

Burdens of the flesh
Our bodies are so weak
We seek the spirit’s truth
To turn the other cheek

Turning the other cheek to see a world broken, lost and vain
How can you ever look at someone else the same way?
We all bleed

The human race
Have some empathy
We are all in pain

If we commiserate
Then we can share the weight
We are all the same
We are all in..

Pain
Every day that I awake
In my blood and through my veins
Now there’s nothing left that you can take away from me

Sail

This is how I show my love
I made it my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
this is how an angel dies
I blame it on my own supply
blame it on my A.D.D. baby

Sail

Maybe i should cry for help
maybe i should kill myself
blame it on my A.D.D. baby
maybe I'm a different breed
maybe I'm not listening
so blame it on my A.D.D. baby

Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight
I throw myself into
And out of the red

Slow how
You wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

If anything could ever be this good again

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go (never)
Never let you go - let me go
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows...

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much

LYRICS
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, 
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today

Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself

And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cuz I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cuz sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

Cuz I don't think that they'd understand

Download the full ""Metallica"" album here: http://smarturl.it/metallicaalbum

SONG FACTS:
Singer and rhythm guitarist ""James Hetfield"" wrote this song while he was on the phone with his girlfriend at this time. Since he held the phone with one hand, he plucked the four open strings of a standard E-minor chord with the other, which eventually made up the first two bars of the song. The lyrics were also dedicated to his girlfriend, which talk about being ""so close, no matter how far"", indicating the bond they shared even when Hetfield was on tour. Initially, the song was not meant to go on the album, and Hetfield had written it for himself, but only after drummer Lars Ulrich heard it was it considered for the record.

This is one of the few Metallica songs where James Hetfield played the guitar solo rather than Kirk Hammett.

Hetfield explained this song to Mojo magazine December 2008. Said the Metcallica singer: ""It's about being on the road, missing someone at home, but it was written in such a way, it connected with so many people, that it wasn't just about two people, it was about a connection with your higher power, lots of different things.""
Hetfield added: ""I remember going to the Hell's Angels Clubhouse in New York, and they showed me a film that they'd put together of one of the fallen brothers, and they were playing Nothing Else Matters. Wow. This means a lot more than me missing my chick, right? This is brotherhood. The army could use this song. It's pretty powerful.""

Hetfield told Mojo that after penning this love ballad, he was initially concerned about playing it to the rest of the band. He explained: ""At first I didn't even want to play it for the guys. I thought that Metallica could only be the four of us. These are songs about destroying things, head banging, bleeding for the crowd, whatever it is, as long as it wasn't about chicks and fast cars, even though that's what we liked. The song was about a girlfriend at the time. It turned out to be a pretty big song.""",164962903,4.87854909897,702508,21998,00:06:26,386,"[Metallica, Nothing, Else, Matters, Official, Music, Video, hd, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, nothing else matters, Classic, Rock, Guitar, Drum, yt:cc=on]",2010-09-13 20:04:28

""Under The Bridge"" Lyrics:

Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all that way

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away",42515802,4.93219900131,201711,3478,00:04:27,267,"[Red Hot Chili Peppers, Under The Bridge, Rock, Music (TV Genre), Alternative Rock (Musical Genre), Pop Rock (Musical Genre), Rock Music (Film Genre), Official, Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Chad Smith, Josh Klinghoffer, Funk Rock (Musical Genre), Funk Metal (Musical Genre), Warner Bros.

Lyrics:

Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching

All the commotion
the kiddie like play
Has people talking
Talking
