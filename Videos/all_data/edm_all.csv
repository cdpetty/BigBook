Lyrics:
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tellme do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again",593766900,4.86732816696,1474532,50585,00:03:47,227,"[Calvin Harris lyrics, Summer, official, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love Official, Outside, cover, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love, download, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love Lyrics, music, CalvinHarrisvevo, audio, lyrics, open wide, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Under Control, feel so close, Calvin Harris, album, acoustic, sweet nothing, official video, single, Calvin Harris feat.

We don't have any doubts saying Destructo may become the people's choice.

When it comes to blowing up the night that man defo got the formula. Gary Richards has been around since the very beginning of good ol´ techno. Here we are not talking about wedding party but massive Rave America at Knotts Berry Farm. Actually this was early 90's when he was organizing warehouse and underground parties in Los Angeles and became a DJ of fame of the scene. In 2007 he created nowadays famous HARD fest and decided to start producing his own weapons for his dj-sets.

Here you can listen to his first work. These 3 tracks sounds eclectic and could be synonymous of deep, breaks, raving techno and house at the same time. Yeah, this genre name dropping sounds suspicious, but not if listening to the first contribution on BNR TRAX. On top of that we have BNR rave-master Jan Driver's monster remix of ""Technology"" and BS1′s fantastic remix of ""LA Funky"".

""The video for ""Love Is Not Enough"" follows the thoughts and emotions of two lost lovers in the final moments of their relationship - just as they realise that the relationship really isn't going to work. The whole video is filmed and edited in reverse, reflecting upon the cyclical nature of relationships. The backwards footage highlights the ambiguity and uncertainty of whether they are emotionally leaving or returning."" Vicky Simmons, Director

Directed by Vicky Simmons, the video for Above & Beyond's ""Love Is Not Enough"" (feat. Zoë Johnston) was shot on Hampstead Heath last December and features two rising stars of the acting world; Emily Beecham and Liam Boyle. Liam has starred in Powder (2010), Awaydays (2009) and Land Girls (2009). Emily has featured in The Calling (2009), 28 Weeks Later (2007) and was considered one of the 55 Faces Of The Future by Nylon Magazine's Young Hollywood issue.

A poignant tale of a deep love that wasn't quite to be, the video for Above & Beyond's ""Love Is Not Enough"" (feat. Zoë Johnston) captures the confusing, frustrating and, ultimately, heart-breaking emotions of those final, fracturing stages of such a relationship in a stirring and cinematic style.

Released on 19th March 2012, Above & Beyond feat. Zoë Johnston ""Love Is Not Enough"" is the latest single from the album ""Group Therapy"" - last year described as ""the artist album of the year"" by dance magazine Mixmag. A full remix package will include the new Above & Beyond Club Mix, and mixes from Kaskade, MRZO (aka Mat Zo), Maor Levi & Bluestone and Sykro.

Lyrics:
I can't believe that every day and every night
It's getting better with you out of my life
It's like I flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes I know I'll feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?

It's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your hair back",45648367,4.85838651657,157754,5790,00:03:51,231,"[Calvin Harris lyrics, Summer, official, Calvin Harris Bounce Official, Calvin Harris Bounce, Outside, cover, download, music, CalvinHarrisvevo, Bounce, audio, lyrics, open wide, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Under Control, Calvin Harris feat.

Lyrics:
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst,
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing",217119122,4.89091730118,800709,22448,00:04:29,269,"[Calvin Harris lyrics, Summer, official, Outside, cover, download, music, Sweet Nothing, CalvinHarrisvevo, audio, florence and the machine, lyrics, open wide, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Under Control, Calvin Harris Sweet Nothing, feel so close, Calvin Harris Sweet Nothing Lyrics, Calvin Harris, Calvin Harris feat.

Lyrics:
If I told you, that this couldn't get better baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same.
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep.
Never worried, cause I can give you what you need.

Now everything I do, is all for loving you.
Its not something that we're used to.
No other way to say, I need you every day.
And now I'm gonna change my ways.
And it's a part of you, I never wanna lose.
I'll do anything you wantme to.
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way-aa-aay.
And if ever I'm alone you'll say.

The unbounded, genre-mashing DJ, producer and industry juggernaut, Diplo, is excited to announce the June 12th release of the Express Yourself EP on his label Mad Decent. The six-track recording from the man who makes up one half of the bombastic duo, Major Lazer, is his first solo release since 2004's Florida and is a product of the artist's fearless endeavors of exploring and unearthing new music from around the world.

In the months since his debut Westside EP on Mad Decent, Dillon Francis has exploded onto the electronic music scene.  He's been touring nonstop throughout the United States and Europe and has remixed tracks for CSS, Toddla T, Chase and Status, Digitalism, and Kissy Sellout.  His collaborative track with Diplo, ""Que Que"" featuring Maluca, was featured on one of the final episodes of HBO's hit series Entourage and his single ""Beautician 2.0"" has been heard in clubs all summer long. Most recently, he premiered his newest single ""I.D.G.A.F.O.S."" during a minimix for Flux Pavillion on BBC's Radio 1 and is currently joining Skrillex on his sold out Mothership Tour.
 
""I.D.G.A.F.O.S."" is the culmination of all of Dillon Francis' signature productions. The melody lines are brighter, the drops larger, and the baselines heavier. It's a roller-coaster of a track and one that really shows the growth in Dillon's production skills.
 
Where ""I.D.G.A.F.O.S."" goes for the heavy drops, ""Beautican 2.0"" ramps up the melody lines, creating a beautiful soundscape that rides along at a smooth 108bpm.  Both tracks help to expand the growing moombahton genre and push Dillon Francis to the forefront of the movement!

Originally released on October 18, 2011.

""Fight For You"" Lyrics:
Meeting you here, the night's alight with midnight cheer
Our dust still unsettled, I feel the plucking of our petals
I'm drawing circles don't you know, protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory
Be friendly but cautious, you're gonna have to count your losses
Easily attracted, but dangerous to get distracted
I'm drawing circles don't you know, protect the seed that wants to grow
To a garden, pardon my territory
I'd fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I'm right for you
This kinda love don't happen everyday
I'd fight for you
I didn't wanna have to raise my voice
I'm right for you
You really leave me with no choice
So what do you want and what are you thinking?
Isn't it about time you stuck up for me?
But what you can't see is we're under siege
And I only fight because I believe
Not gonna share you no
I'd fight for you
I never knew that I could feel this way
I'm right for you
This kinda love don't happen everyday
I'd fight for you
I didn't wanna have to raise my voice
I'm right for you
You really leave me with no choice Subscribe to Nettwerk's YouTube channel:

Yeah
Feelin' fantastic...cmon
Man a group like this you never could've expected:
Cocktail mixed with some Loggy and Kinetics

So just relax
Lay back and Be Easy
Take your time, let it go, live freely
And Be Easy (You know)

Palm trees, palm trees where we sit 'n' write
Strong drinks, strong drinks what we sippin' like
Their on me, on me cuz we're living right
And who's sayin' that some new love can't begin tonight?
Well I didnt, and neither did you
And only got essentials, yeah reefer for two
And now you got me goin' mental, ain't a thing I can do
You're sinking deeper in my chest as I'm thinkin of you 
And so the sun melts with a unified brilliance
I find words to describe you in the millions
Sweet sublimals but your a villainous
A sweet criminal stealin' all my feelings for yourself
And watch the shadows stretch across the pavement
And when the coastline wonders where the waves went
My thoughts surface, crept up from the basement
Giving me a hint that you know im gunna take with 

So just relax
Lay back and Be Easy
Take your time, let it go, live freely
And Be Easy 

I watch the sun travel over the sky
See how long I can survive without a phone at my side
And in this moment I can flashback back to my youth
Imagine a BlackBerry and fathom an Apple as actual fruits
Speakin' of apples, I love the city I reside
But why these people kill themselves over their 9 to 5s?
All these items that are gilded aren't gold inside
How much lifestyle must you buy before you feel alive?
Those dreams covered in glitter couldn't be hollower
Even without a Twitter you're still considered a follower
So if I was starry-eyed, sorry, I apologize
I just hit up Loggy for a collie ride
And we took a pair of headphones from the east coast (Kinetics)
And a little Cali bud from the west (yo it's Loggy)
And stirred it up inside a cocktail (yeah)
And then we ended up with this...be easy

So just relax
Lay back and Be Easy
Take your time, let it go, live freely
And Be Easy (You know)
Lay back and be easy
Just take your time, let it go, live freely
Be Easy
Just relax, lay back, Be Easy
Take your time, let it go, live freely",1676120,4.90897417068,7601,177,00:04:06,246,"[Summer Ball, Loggy Music, Big Red, Josh Cocktail, Kinetics and One Love, Be Easy, Love, Summer, Radical Something, Music Video, Official Music Video, We Were Just Kids, Say Yes, Step Right Up, Hollister, Pure, Spraypaint, Cheap Drink]",2011-06-13 13:10:15,100,80,70,80,70,60,90,70,60,90,80,70,100,90,80,120,100,90,230,220,210,110,90,80,110,80,70,130,110,100,edm

There is absolutely no let up in the tempo coming from Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike. After a sensational five Beatport #1s this year alone, the Belgian superstars get ready to let rip with their latest hit single 'Stampede'. As ferocious and as unrelenting as the name implies, the track is a collaboration of mammoth proportions with Canadian producers DVBBS & Borgeous, currently conquering the charts with 'Tsunami'. 

Kicking off with a sumptuous run of chords and arpeggios that deliver shivers and goosebumps in abundance, it's not long before the track erupts with the high octance bassline force these artists are world renowned for. Stomping all across the bass and treble lines, 'Stampede' treads the line between ethereal and downright filthy with perfect balance.

New World Sound joins forces with up and coming Thomas Newson for a massive collaboration on brand new single 'Flute', to go out on DOORN on 11th November. 
 
A 50 second preview was released last week hyping the video as a tantalising teaser for the track, which already racked up over 180,000 views on Youtube and hit #1 in the ADE Buzz Chart. The ID left everybody under the impression it was a new collab from W&W and Blasterjaxx. Originally keeping the artists a secret Spinnin' reveals now the genius behind the track as New World Sound and Thomas Newson. 
 
Built around the haunting pan flute that leads into a thumping bassline, the track combines an intense riff at the core of the track layered with the classical flute to create a peak time dance floor filler.
 
New World Sound aka 21 and 19 year old brothers Tyrone and Jesse Taylor are two DJ/ Producers currently dominating their homeland around the Gold Coast of Australia, and the world. Their first release 'Peak' earned them huge support from artists such as Tiesto, Ferry Corsten and Judge Jules as well as a score of other hugely influential artists.
 
New World Sound emerged from the studio again in October 2012 with 'Bantam', a dubstep infused club banger, and received praise from the Grammy Award winning David Guetta, placing it on his monthly top 10 Beatport chart and playing it twice on his F**k Me I'm Famous podcast. The release of 'Aye' in June 2013 marked the duo's signing to Avicii's label LE7ELS and earned New World Sound their first ever BBC Radio 1 play during Pete Tong's weekly essential collection show. They host a weekly radio show on Australia's premiere Dance Music Station, Radio Metro.
 
Thomas Newson is only 19 year old, yet he looks set to be one of the next up and coming producers. With support from Hardwell dropping his track 'Pallaroid' during his explosive set at Tomorrowland this year, this relative newcomer is one to look out for.",9462455,4.86999845505,64152,2155,00:03:30,210,"[New World Sound, Thomas Newson, Flute, Music Video, spinnintv]",2013-11-21 08:58:57,30,20,10,40,30,20,50,40,30,50,40,20,60,60,40,60,50,40,40,30,10,70,60,50,60,50,30,40,20,10,edm

The French born DJ and Producer has been based out in Miami for a number of years now and is currently making name in EDM's ever growing DJ movement state side. After the teaser video of his new record 'Molly' was revealed, the buzz around this talented producer grew exponentially and we're not surprised. Madonna, who made a surprise appearance during Ultra Music Festival, called out to the 20.000 ravers asking them if they knew where Molly was, making 'Molly' one of Miami's highlights of the week according to Billboard Magazine. Besides the popstars' support, Cedric's new tune has been noted by BBC Radio 1's Pete Tong (Essential New Tune) among a great list of some of the biggest DJ names in this bizz. Its heavy bass lines and infectious mid-section make 'Molly' a certified summer anthem that will have crowds going wild across the globe and appears to be evidence that the move continues to only feed Gervais' creative genius.
