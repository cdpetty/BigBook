Lyrics:

Sun tanned toes ticklin the sand
Colddrink chillin in my right hand
Watchin you sleep in the evening light
Restin up for a long, long night

[Chorus:]
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

All day long just takin it easy
Layin in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

[Chorus:]
When the sun goes down,we'll be groovin
When the sun goes down,we'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to dobut breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play


When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
She thinks Kracker's Sexy when the sun goes down

We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin
When the sun goes down, hey Uncle Kenny
When the sun goes down over the water,

Johnathan East 
Born and raised in Clay County, Alabama, Singer / Songwriter Johnathan East has always had a passion for music.  He started playing guitar around the age of thirteen and began writing and singing songs about his southern country life, the lifestyle that he grew up around, in addition to stories that came from true life experiences and down home living.  

After years of just playing for friends, Johnathan decided to break out into the local music scene.  He played at wedding receptions, birthday parties and private events in and around his hometown of Lineville, Alabama.  Playing around town, the locals fell in love with this modern country singer because of his genuine style and his rebel attitude.  

His first appearance in the local music scene was at AJ's restaurant in Anniston.  He was soon known across east Alabama and parts of Georgia for his different style of country music.  Johnathan was making his way to the top of the local music scene.  His music career was becoming a success after all the hard work and dedication he put into his passion and love of music. 

In 2007, Johnathan released his very first self-produced album, ""Grits and Gravy"".  In the years that followed, Johnathan released several more albums, ""One Horse Town"",  ""Hayseed"",  ""Fresh Out of Love Songs"" , ""Hangin' By a Thread"", and his most recent album, ""Free Advice"".

In December, 2011, Johnathan decided to take his music production to a whole different level.  He released a music video to his song ""American Boy"" and with that, he had so much positive feedback, that he immediately began working on a second music video.  This video was to his original song that is a fan favorite, ""A Little on the Redneck Side"".  He released this video in April, 2013, and with the video, the popularity of the song continues to grow.

With all of Johnathan's songwriting ventures thus far and more to come in the future, he decided to form his own Record Label, Grass Roots Records, LLC, his own Publishing Company, Triple East Music and his own music company, Triple E Entertainment, LLC, all which promote his original music.

In addition to songwriting, Johnathan East has recently been touring around the Southeast playing his original music, along with a number of country and southern rock cover songs as an acoustic act and with The Johnathan East Band.  

A Little on the Redneck Side
Well, I come from the South, I’m a rolling stone
The woods of Alabama is where I call my home
I’m a country boy and I don’t belong
Among the bright lights of L. A.
Got a pick-up truck with a straight pipe sound
Come Friday night, I ride through town
Got the radio up and windows rolled down
All the women they look my way.

‘Cause I’m a fun loving, beer chugging, reckless kind that don’t take nothing
Put me down, we can sure enough step outside
I like Jim Beam and John Wayne, us good ole boys we’re all the same
With a big hell yeah and a whole lot of American pride
Just a little on the Redneck side.

Weekend comes, I’ve got a steel guitar
Blaring out loud from a roadhouse bar
So put a dollar in that ole tip jar
And play another country song
We got late night women and ole pool halls
Cigar smoke and barroom brawls
And with them deer heads up on the wall
Honey, that’s what I call home.

Faded jeans and a flannel shirt
Carhartt boots caked up in dirt

Lyrics:

Yes, she blew through the door like TNT,
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me.
Said: ""I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time.
""I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline.
""I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey.
""Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country.""

Yeah, the band took a break,
The DJ played P Diddy.
She said: ""I didn't come here to hear,
""Somethin' thumpin' from the city.""
Said: ""I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money.
""Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.

Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around
And cruised right through the heart of my town Anything you say would be a lie
We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya'
Where I come from
There's an old farm boy out turning up dirt Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt Where I come from
When a couple of boys fight in the parking lot No, nobody's gonna call the cops Where I come from
See that door right there, man I swear
It ain't never been locked
And I Guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rocking chair
At the courthouse square I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his million without one day of schoolin'
Where I come from
There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down Where I come from
The pine trees are singing a song of the south Where I come from
That little white church is gonna have a crowd Yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of where I come from.
Where I come from
There's a big ole' moon shining down at night Where I come from
There's a man done wrong gonna make it right Where I come from
There's an old farm boy out turning up dirt Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt Where I come from
When a couple of boys fight in the parking lot No, ain't nobody gonna call the cops
Yeah, that river runs across that Oakland rock Where I come from

Lyrics:

Every morning I get up before that rooster crows
Headed straight to somewhere I don't even want to go
Eggs and bacon in my belly and a Folger's coffee buzz
Good ol' radar detector it protects me from the fuzz
Well I do what I gotta do to get through working that 9 to 5
It's killing me but then again it's keeping me alive

It puts the gas in my truck, butter on my biscuits,
Couple bucks when I'm itchin', for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
But I still got running water and they ain't cutoff the lights
Come Friday night my friends and I start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts beer on the table

Eighteen bucks an hour and a million dollar tan
All them women whistle at me while I'm working for the man
Making me some cold hard cash out in that summer sun
Come Friday I'll have money but by Monday I'll have none
Once the bills are paid and that bass boat tank has gone from E to F
I fill that big ol' cooler up there ain't a whole lot left

But I got gas in my truck,butter on my biscuits,
Couple bucks when I'm itchin', for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
But I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
Come Friday night my friends and I start peeling off them labels
Working hard all week puts the beer on the table

Ohhhh, wohhhh, I'm a simple man, yes I am
All I need is a few good friends and a good job,
And a good dog, maybe a woman that understands

An' a little gas in my truck, some butter on my biscuits,
Couple bucks when I'm itchin', for a scratch-off ticket
That poker makes me broker every Saturday night
But I still got running water and they ain't cut off the lights
Come Friday night my friends and I start peeling off them labels

Lyrics:

""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song...

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin my first love out to the levvy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song....

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back, I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir
Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, 

I go back....
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back....
To watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall...
I go back....
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him...
I go back... I go back...

Lyrics:

I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found but

Who I am with you is who I really want to be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands

Lyrics:

Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ho

Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat, no way I'm gonna beat this summer with you",11187851,4.79445362091,25826,1399,00:04:38,278,"[crushin it, she's everything, official, hq, brad paisley beat this summer, brad paisley lyrics, the world, never gonna beat this summer, cover, karaoke, download, brad paisley official, music, remind me, brad paisley beat this summer live, playlist, Arista Nashville, Beat This Summer, beat this summer, audio, brad paisley songs, lyrics, music video, live, vevo, Sony, gospel songs, album, acoustic, brad paisley beat this summer lyrics]",2013-04-12 19:26:18

Lyrics:

Tank top, love handles
Tube socks, Jesus sandals
Cheap blender, icebucket
Raw oysters, yeah, give me one and shuck it

Holds up a frozen orange daiquiri
And laughs, here's to the boys at the factory

No more building transmissions
He's going deep sea fishing
Catch a marlin, catch a tan
Catch a local cover band

Hey, you gotta watch that man
He'll go coastal on ya

Silver hair, silver Buick
Winter's coming, better move it
Southbound before they get snowed under
Call the kids, tell 'em see you next summer

No more freezing their tails off
It's cataractsunglasses and a round of golf
Red skin, green plaid, margarita, dog track
Before you know it Mom and Dad
They'll go coastal on ya

Sounds so good, got me thinking
What do y'all say after I'm done singing

Better keep your eye on me

Lyrics:

It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean

Lyrics:

If you're going out with someone new
I'mgoing out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel roomjust to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

Lyrics:

Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile,
Me and Mary making our way into the night,
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides,
The pinball bills, skee ball slides,
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight,
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her,
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Ooooooooo...

And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could everbe anything but mine

Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Ooooooooooo... ooooooooooooooo...

... And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine

Lyrics:

Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the Canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many,one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Never enough
You and Tequila

Written By: Dallas Davidson

Lyrics:
Well every time I turn around I see some dude dressed like a clown
Baggy pants and a Cap on sideways
They don't say Ma'am or Sir no more they won't even hold a door for a woman
Well it's a crying shame

Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?
Must be workin' on a farm or out there chasing rainbows
Are they back in Oklahoma or in a Texas rodeo?
Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?

Are they sitting on a an old bar stool or telling lies and cutting a fool
talking about 'the way it was' and wishing?
Down in Orange Beach, Alabama hanging out at the Flora-Bama heading out the
pass and goin' fishin'?

Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?
Must be workin on a farm or out there chasing rainbows
Are they hiding down in Georgia or in a Texas rodeo?
Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?

Are they drivin' cattle and a ridin' high living life the Cowboy way?
Or Down there on the front line fighting off the bad guys, giving them hell
for the good ole USA?

Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?
Must be workin on a farm or out there chasing rainbows
Are they back in oklahoma or in a texas rodeo?
Tell me where did all the Good Ole Boys Go?
Yeah just where the hell did all the good ole boys go?

(I know where a few of them are, down there in southern Oklahoma, even some
down in Texas, I even saw one on NY one time, you know what i'm talking
about ladies,hell I'll hold the door for you, I'll hold your purse for you,
I'll even go pick up some feminine products for you, that's what a good ole
by would do)

Lyrics:

Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early
Boys, we ought'a shut her down
Just take it tothe house
'Fore anybody starts gettin' crazy
So, I started walkin' across the floor
Before I got to the door.

Aw naw, somebody just bought a shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay
Aw naw, look at the time, y'all
What happened to coats on, long gone
I should be halfway home, but aw naw",12382713,4.86514425278,50100,1748,00:03:08,188,"[Chris Young Aw Naw live, Chris Young Aw Naw lyrics, hq, official, Chris Young lonely eyes, Chris Young who I am with you, cover, Chris Young i'm comin' over, karaoke, download, Chris Young Aw Naw cover, music, Chris Young You, playlist, Chris Young Aw Naw, Chris Young official, audio, lyrics, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Chris Young live, album, Chris Young, acoustic, official video, Chris Young Aw Naw official, Chris, Young, Aw, Naw, star]",2013-06-27 07:00:38
