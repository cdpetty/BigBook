LYRICS: 
So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel I appreciate the time I’m not alone
(Why don’t you get my lawyer on the phone)
 
There were days these child eyes 
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate… and oh I felt control
(It appears these sheep have quite an appetite)
 
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
 
As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn’t notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, Everyone’s got a sob story)
 
Jesus Christ, was born to die 
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We’re simply sociopaths with no communication baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(So, what’s your cross to bear)
 
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way 
I believe in answers 
Just not today   
 
Hope my wheels don’t abandon me now, seein’ that I’m out here alone
I’m runnin’ out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice, guiding me to her arms
Mother, I’m alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind 
Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time to wake up
Won’t you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?  Just wake up
Can’t you wake up?
 
(You do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?)
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way 
I believe in answers 
Just not today

LYRICS: 

You got two black eyes from loving too hard
And a black car that matches your blackest soul
I wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no
The neon coast was your sign
And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
Wouldn't change ya, oh oh
Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive
Swimming pools under desert skies
Drinking white wine in the blushing light
Just another LA Devotee
Sunsets on the evil eye
Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
Always on the hunt for a little more time
Just another LA Devotee

You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
I couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no
The high rise lights read your rights
And a downtown storm with Aries rising
Couldn't change ya, oh oh
Couldn't ever try to make you see, no

Static palms melt your vibe
Midnight whisperings

The black magic of Mulholland Drive

LYRICS

I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,
But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.
My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from,
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,

It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face,
Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.",748106349,4.86913585663,4574984,154738,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, stressed out, 21 pilots, twentyonepilots, fueled by ramen, FBR, fueledbyramen, music, song, tyler joseph, josh dun, TOP]",2015-04-28 03:05:18,189,189,189,173,173,173,139,129,153,162,161,161,157,156,148,156,156,156,115,115,117,139,137,137,72,86,86,180,180,180,rock

LYRICS

I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.",297410644,4.91078805923,2080947,47470,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, ride, blurry face, Fueled By Ramen, FBR, 21 pilots, twentyone pilots, fueledbyramen, tyler joseph, josh dun]",2015-05-13 22:00:26,15,17,18,60,59,60,122,122,123,89,89,88,104,108,114,58,58,59,107,107,107,84,84,83,69,69,70,121,116,112,rock

LYRICS

Stuck in the same routine 
Living an empty dream
When am I gonna wake up　
Thought we had it right　
Now it's an endless night　
Where is it gonna take us　

Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

I know i know 
we’re taking off together 
even though we always  
crash and burn　
tonight you and I 
will fall from the sky　
drag me all the way to hell　
cuz I’m never gonna let it go 
never gonna let it go　

Build a broken heart 
Watching it fall apart　
Maybe this is how I like it　
Sink your teeth in
Give me what I want　
Love the way it hurts

Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

I know I know 
we’re taking off together 
even though we always  
crash and burn　
tonight you and I 
will fall from the sky　
drag me all the way to hell　
cuz I’m never gonna let it go 

I know I know
I'm never gonna let it go
I know I know　
never gonna let it go
I know I know
drag me all the way to hell　
cuz I’m never gonna let it go 

Don't lie, you know everything you do is killing me

I know i know 
we’re taking off together 
even though we always  
crash and burn　
tonight you and I 
will fall from the sky　
drag me all the way to hell

Lyrics:
If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

LYRICS
You don't have to lie
I know exactly where you've been
Cos' you're chewing off my ear
While you're chewing on your chin
No we're not on the level
You're just off your face
It's not a state of mind no
Your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside
But you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now
I think it's time to pack it in
Don't call it a party
Cos it never stops
Now one is too many
But it's never enough
Don't tell me you're happy
Cos this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for
Who you trying to fool
You know you're in over your head
Cos' your holding on to heaven
But you're hanging by a thread.
Oh no.
