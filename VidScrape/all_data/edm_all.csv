Lyrics:
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tellme do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again",593766900,4.86732816696,1474532,50585,00:03:47,227,"[Calvin Harris lyrics, Summer, official, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love Official, Outside, cover, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love, download, Calvin Harris I Need Your Love Lyrics, music, CalvinHarrisvevo, audio, lyrics, open wide, music video, live, vevo, Sony, Under Control, feel so close, Calvin Harris, album, acoustic, sweet nothing, official video, single, Calvin Harris feat.

We don't have any doubts saying Destructo may become the people's choice.

When it comes to blowing up the night that man defo got the formula. Gary Richards has been around since the very beginning of good ol´ techno. Here we are not talking about wedding party but massive Rave America at Knotts Berry Farm. Actually this was early 90's when he was organizing warehouse and underground parties in Los Angeles and became a DJ of fame of the scene. In 2007 he created nowadays famous HARD fest and decided to start producing his own weapons for his dj-sets.

Here you can listen to his first work. These 3 tracks sounds eclectic and could be synonymous of deep, breaks, raving techno and house at the same time. Yeah, this genre name dropping sounds suspicious, but not if listening to the first contribution on BNR TRAX. On top of that we have BNR rave-master Jan Driver's monster remix of ""Technology"" and BS1′s fantastic remix of ""LA Funky"".

""The video for ""Love Is Not Enough"" follows the thoughts and emotions of two lost lovers in the final moments of their relationship - just as they realise that the relationship really isn't going to work. The whole video is filmed and edited in reverse, reflecting upon the cyclical nature of relationships. The backwards footage highlights the ambiguity and uncertainty of whether they are emotionally leaving or returning."" Vicky Simmons, Director

Directed by Vicky Simmons, the video for Above & Beyond's ""Love Is Not Enough"" (feat. Zoë Johnston) was shot on Hampstead Heath last December and features two rising stars of the acting world; Emily Beecham and Liam Boyle. Liam has starred in Powder (2010), Awaydays (2009) and Land Girls (2009). Emily has featured in The Calling (2009), 28 Weeks Later (2007) and was considered one of the 55 Faces Of The Future by Nylon Magazine's Young Hollywood issue.

A poignant tale of a deep love that wasn't quite to be, the video for Above & Beyond's ""Love Is Not Enough"" (feat. Zoë Johnston) captures the confusing, frustrating and, ultimately, heart-breaking emotions of those final, fracturing stages of such a relationship in a stirring and cinematic style.

Released on 19th March 2012, Above & Beyond feat. Zoë Johnston ""Love Is Not Enough"" is the latest single from the album ""Group Therapy"" - last year described as ""the artist album of the year"" by dance magazine Mixmag. A full remix package will include the new Above & Beyond Club Mix, and mixes from Kaskade, MRZO (aka Mat Zo), Maor Levi & Bluestone and Sykro.
