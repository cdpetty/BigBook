Lyrics:

If you don`t love me just say
I`ll never stay in your way
Nobody hurt me this way
Give me a reason to stay

I wonder, wonder, wonder why
I wonder why x2

Why, why do you hurt me?
Why, why does it hurt?

Can we just stop with the blame
We``re turning love into hate
I know we won`t be the same
We`ve got no reason to wait

I wonder, wonder, wonder why
I wonder why

Why, why do you hurt me?
Why, why does it hurt?

Lyrics: Sorry – Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I’m sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I’m sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I’m sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

10,James Arthur - Say You Won't Let Go.mp4,JamesAVEVO,"James Arthur 麓Say You Won麓t Let Go麓
out September 9th 2016
Buy the song here      https://smg.lnk.to/sayyouwontletgoEC Listen here on Spotify https://open.spotify.com/track/5uCax9HTNlzGybIStD3vDh
In just a few short weeks  James has made an unbelievable comeback with his new single 麓Say You Won麓t Let Go.麓 Following two years away from the spotlight  the 2012 winner of 麓X Factor麓 has held the #1 spot on the Official Charts for several weeks in the UK  Ireland  Australia  New Zealand and Sweden! James became the first British lead artist to hold the top spot on the chart for more than one week this year  and was also confirmed as the best-selling British singles artist in 2016.  麓Say You Won麓t Let Go麓 has quickly become a worldwide hit  having topped iTunes  Spotify  Shazam and official singles charts around the globe.
 
麓You麓ve got to founder if you麓re scared of your own feelings.麓 Say You Won麓t Let Go tells the moving story of a love  which nearly would麓ve been defeated by fear of permitting emotions. James words the fright of opening up grippingly: 麓I knew I loved you then  but you never know. Cos I played it cool when I was scared of letting go麓 His incomparable voice strikes a chord in the deeply moving ballad as James finds the courage to sing quite frankly of his own life-experiences  which in turn adds much haunting quality to his music. Having spent time in foster care  he sometimes has had difficulties to trust  he says  describing the idea behind 麓Say You Won麓t Let Go麓. Nevertheless  the song also sketches out his career  which still seems to be on the brink of just starting out. Recorded in London and Los Angeles  and co-written with some of the world麓s A-List songwriters and producers  James Arthur麓s new album Back From The Edge (out October 28th 2016) encompasses his experiences over the past few years and reflects his true  honest self. The album also showcases James麓s versatile style  taking inspiration from soul  rock and hip-hop  all while topping pre-order charts around the globe.

Speaking of the album  James added: 麓I am so proud of this album. The past few years have been a bit of a rollercoaster and this album really shows an honest reflection of that. The support so far has been so incredible  and I hope this record will resonate with everyone.麓

Lyrics: 

Verse 1:
 
Part of me
Is part of you
So take my hand
I want you to feel
Words you can’t hear
I love you so
And you love me
So tell me why
Why does it feel
Like we’re thousand miles apart
 
Bridge:
 
For better or for worse you stood next to me 
Always found a way not to give up on me 
Remember when you used to say
 
Chorus:
 
You know our love can save it all
We’ve been together for so long
So don’t give up on who we are
We’ll work it out somehow
You know a word can change it all
I had my doubts but now i know
I wanna be with you for life
Each day and every night
Because our love can save it all
 
Verse 2:
 
I wish there was
Another me
Another you
So we could go back
To the point where we met
Another place
Another chance
We’ll make it right
So meet me halfway
I know you feel the same

I ain't worried bout nothin
I ain't wearin na nada
I'm sitting pretty, impatient
But I know you gotta
Put in those hours
Imma make it harder
I'm sendin pic after picture
Imma get you fired
I know you're always on that night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
I don't need no explanation
Baby you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go towork
But you gotta put in work
You don't gotta go to work
Let my body do the work
We can work from home

Let's put it into motion
Imma give you a promotion
I'll make it feel like a vacay
Turn the bed into an ocean
We don't need nobody
I just need your body
Nothin but sheets in between us
Ain't no gettin off early

Oh, yeah
Girl gotta work for me
Can you make it clap
No hands for me
Take it to the ground
Pick it up for me
Look back at it
All on for me
Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
Imma buy her no Celine
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
Ride or die, she gone go
I won't judge, she finesse
I pipe her, she take that
Puttin' overtime on your body

Calvin Harris - My Way (Lyrics)

Why wait 
To say
At least I did it my way 
Lie awake 
Two faced 
But in my heart I understand 
I made 
My move 
And it was all about you 
Now I feel 
So far removed 

You were the one thing in my way 

My way
Away away away",62572124,4.8899769783,665966,18836,00:04:04,244,"[my way, calvin harris my way, calvin harris this is what you came for, calvin harris my way instrumental, Calvin Harris, My Way, calvin harris my way lyrics, calvin harris rihanna, my way official video, my way remix, my way live, calvin harris haim, calvin harris summer, calvin harris my way audio, Columbia, calvin harris my way official video, Dance, calvin harris my way cover, calvin harris my way remix, calvin harris vevo, calvin, harris]",2016-10-28 07:00:01

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it, maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

LYRICS

I just want to stay in the sun where I find,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Pieces of peace in the sun’s peace of mind,
I know it’s hard sometimes,
Yeah I think about the end just way too much,
But it’s fun to fantasize,
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,
But it’s fun to fantasize.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,
We have a list of people that we would take,
A bullet for them, a bullet for you,
A bullet for everybody in this room,
But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,
See many bullets coming through,
Metaphorically I’m the man,
But literally I don’t know what I’d do,
“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,
Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,
Even harder to write when you know that tonight,
There were people back home who tried talking to you,
But then you ignored them still,
All these questions they’re for real,
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.

I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,
I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.

I’ve been thinking too much,
Help me.",297410644,4.91078805923,2080943,47470,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, ride, blurry face, Fueled By Ramen, FBR, 21 pilots, twentyone pilots, fueledbyramen, tyler joseph, josh dun]",2015-05-13 22:00:26

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we’ll never forget.“

LYRICS:
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
Tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no

Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

Can be, can be
Be each other's company
Be each other's company
Just be each other's company
Be each other’s company
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

Tamo' en vivo 
Sube sube sube el mic mic
Que vamo’ que vamo’ 
Que vamo para jodadera a full baby 

Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Cómo es, dame una vueltita otra vez 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Tú la ves, como hace lo suyo, tú la ves 

La zona destroza, que esto es otra cosa 
Esto es pa` todas las bebas que se ponen rabiosa 
Es tan peligrosa con las curvas nitrosas
Se cae la casa cuando ella rompe la losa 

Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto, dale duro 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto, dale duro 

Se pone bien loca cuando a ti te toca 
Toda la sanduga en ese bompe te choca choca 
Tú no bailas como yo, tú no bailas como yo 
Mucho piquete, mucho flow flow nos matamos 

Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Cómo es, dame una vueltita otra vez 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Tú la ves, como hace lo suyo, tú la ves 

Las botellas arriba, el combo en la mesa 
Y salen fieras por naturaleza 
Vamo' a ver toa' las chapi en candela 
Hay que llevarlas pa' la vieja escuela 

Ahí es que va a apretar 
Échate eso pa' acá
Las nalgas para atrás y tra tra tra tra 
Ahí es que va a apretar 
Échate eso pa' acá 
Las nalgas para atrás y tra tra tra tra
Con tu jean siempre cuando le roza el booty 
Le tiro sustancia más caliente que churry 
Ella es otro level, cuando me lo mueve 
Sopa de rafagasos sin llevar una nueve 
Se explota como un peine, yo exploto como un largo 
Me debe la pista y su cintura la embargo 
Le gusta la pesca, porque es una fresca 
Siga pal bailoteo que se coma este pargo

Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Cómo es, dame una vueltita otra vez 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Tú la ves, tiene una sandunga en esos pies 

Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto, dale duro 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto (terremoto) 
Terremoto, fuimos! 

Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Vamo' a ver cómo lo sostiene 
Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Que mueva to' lo que tiene 
Vamo' a ver cómo lo sostiene con el..

Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky

Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky 
Tú la ves, como ella te vira al revés

LYRICS

I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard,
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words,
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new,
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang,

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink,
But now I’m insecure and I care what people think.
My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young,
How come I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from,
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it,
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably only sell one,

It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose,
Same clothes homegrown a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam,
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered,
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter.

My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.

We used to play pretend, give each other different names,
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away,
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face,
Saying, “wake up, you need to make money.""

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days,
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out.",748106349,4.86913537979,4574981,154738,00:03:45,225,"[twenty one pilots, blurryface, stressed out, 21 pilots, twentyonepilots, fueled by ramen, FBR, fueledbyramen, music, song, tyler joseph, josh dun, TOP]",2015-04-28 03:05:18

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Don’t want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you’re down and then between

Ohh I really want to know…

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won’t let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you’re down and then between
Ohh I really want to know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don’t want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Lyrics:
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up

It was a crush
Now I might have went and said too much
But that's all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

YeahI'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept saying I'mma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up, ooh

No tricks,no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah the sun won't set on us

Yeah! Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worry

Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I'mma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when morning comes
Doin' it all nite, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

LYRICS:
I won’t just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can’t write my story
I’m beyond the archetype

I won’t just conform
No matter how you shake my core
‘Cause my roots they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don’t doubt it, don’t doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I’ll fight it, I’ll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire’s at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They’re whispering, ""You’re out of time”
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don’t be surprised
I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don’t doubt it, don’t doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

‘Cause when, when the fire’s at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They’re whispering, ""You’re out of time”
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don’t be surprised
I will still rise

Don’t doubt it, don’t doubt it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it
Don’t be surprised
I will still rise

Lyrics:

Nobody ever knows 
Nobody ever sees 
I left my soul 
Back there now I'm too weak 
Most nights I pray for you to come home 
Praying to the Lord 
Praying for my soul 

Now Please Don't Go 
Most Nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now Please Don't Go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So Please Don't Go 

Cause I don't ever want to know 
Don't ever want to see things change 
Cause when I'm living on my own 
I'll wanna take it back and start again 
Most nights I pray for you to come home 
Praying to the Lord 
Praying for my soul 

Now Please Don't Go 
Most Nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now Please Don't Go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So Please Don't Go 

(Oh oh oh) 
I send so many messages you don't reply! 
(Oh oh oh) 
I gotta figure out what am I missing babe! 
Singing now (Oh oh oh) 
And I need you now, I need your love! 
(Oh oh oh) 

Now Please Don't Go 
Most Nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now Please Don't Go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So Please Don't 
Please Don't Go 

Please Don't Go 
Please Don't Go 
Please Don't Go 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So Please Don't Go

Working with Diplo we discussed how he wanted to convey this simple message with a real sense of beauty, authenticity and genuine feeling. Because Fuse’s family is from Ghana, and he was over there recording, we thought it would bring a really interesting aesthetic to film the video there. Delving deeper into Ghanaian culture, we found that their traditional funeral ceremonies perfectly exemplify this sense of coming together to rise up against sadness. 

The whole community joins together, first in mourning the death, then in celebrating the life that was lived. We worked closely with a Ghanaian family and rural village, meeting the elders and receiving their blessing to film and partake in a real funeral ceremony. 

We wanted to base the video in this very real, documentary world but also tried to capture a sense of journey and passing of the deceased’s spirit by adding a surreal tone to our visuals, both in terms of the way we filmed the funeral but also by adding some more ethereal elements to the piece. 

I found a poem ""Kae” [Remember] written in a traditional Ghanaian language; Twe, which felt like the perfect companion to the video as it is about reflecting on sadness but rising up and looking to the future and to new life.
